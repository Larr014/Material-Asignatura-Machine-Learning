Honestly, I never made any sense to me. It is two different types of viruses. So not now the flu shot works for all viruses? Concerningly, the latest research shows that getting the flu vaccine increases the risk of getting the coronavirus by 36%!!! Here\\u2019s the first link: \\u201cInfluenza Vaccination and Respiratory Virus Interference Among Department of Defense Personnel During the 2017-2018 Influenza Season. \\u201cFlu Vaccine Increases Coronavirus Risk 36% Says Military Study\\u201d. \\u201cExamining non-influenza viruses specifically, the odds of both coronavirus and human metapneumovirus in vaccinated individuals were significantly higher when compared to unvaccinated individuals (OR = 1.36 and 1.51, respectively) (Table 5).\\u201d Paraphrasing, the study highlights the value of the human body\\u2019s ability to fight against viruses. Apparently, by contracting influenza, the body naturally \\u201cmay reduce the risk of non-influenza respiratory viruses\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cWhile influenza vaccination offers protection against influenza, natural influenza infection may reduce the risk of non-influenza respiratory viruses by providing temporary, non-specific immunity against these viruses. On the other hand, recently published studies have described the phenomenon of vaccine-associated virus interference; that is, vaccinated individuals may be at increased risk for other respiratory viruses because they do not receive the non-specific immunity associated with natural infection.\\u201d Like I blogged about before, the flu shot is known to actually suppress your immune system.\",\n          \"A new report, sent to the White House science adviser, says the country should not rely on warm weather to stop contagion.The homebound and virus-wary across the Northern Hemisphere, from President Trump to cooped-up schoolchildren, have clung to the possibility that the coronavirus pandemic will fade in hot weather, as some viral diseases do.But the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, in a public report sent to the White House, has said, in effect: Don\\u2019t get your hopes up. After reviewing a variety of research reports, a panel concluded that the studies, of varying quality of evidence, do not offer a basis to believe that summer weather will interfere with the spread of the coronavirus.The pandemic may lessen because of social distancing and other measures, but the evidence so far does not inspire confidence in the benefits of sun and humidity.  The report, sent to Kelvin Droegemeier, director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy at the White House and acting director of the National Science Foundation, was a brief nine-page communication known as a rapid expert consultation.Kristian Andersen, an immunologist at the Scripps Research Translational Institute in California and a member of the Standing Committee on Emerging Infectious Diseases and 21st Century Health Threats at the National Academies, said: \\u201cGiven current data, we believe that the pandemic likely will not diminish because of summer, and we should be careful not to base policies and strategies around the hope that it will.\\u201d\\u201cWe might very well see a reduction in spread in the beginning of the summer,\\u201d he added, \\u201cbut we have to be careful not to put that down to a changing climate \\u2014 it is plausible that such a reduction could be due to other measures put in place.\\u201dHuman behavior will be most important. Dr. David Relman, who studies host-microbe interactions at Stanford, said if a human coughs or sneezes enough virus \\u201cclose enough to the next susceptible person, then temperature and humidity just won\\u2019t matter that much.\\u201dThe report from the National Academies, independent agencies that advise the government and the public, cited a small number of well-controlled laboratory studies that show that high temperature and humidity can diminish the ability of the novel coronavirus to survive in the environment. But the report noted the studies had limitations that made them less than conclusive.It also noted that although some reports showed pandemic growth rates peaking in colder conditions, those studies were short and limited. A preliminary finding in one such study, by scientists at M.I.T., found fewer cases of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, in warmer climates, but arrived at no definitive conclusion.\\u201cSpecially in the U.S., any effect, even in the summer months, may not be highly visible, so our real chance to stop this virus is indeed through taking quarantine measures,\\u201d said Qasim Bukhari, a computational scientist at M.I.T. who is a co-author of the study.The report sent to the White House also struck a cautionary note: \\u201cGiven that countries currently in \\u2018summer\\u2019 climates, such as Australia and Iran, are experiencing rapid virus spread, a decrease in cases with increases in humidity and temperature elsewhere should not be assumed,\\u201d it said.Pandemics do not behave the same way seasonal outbreaks do. For the National Academies\\u2019 report, researchers looked at the history of flu pandemics as an example. \\u201cThere have been 10 influenza pandemics in the past 250-plus years \\u2014 two started in the Northern Hemisphere winter, three in the spring, two in the summer and three in the fall,\\u201d the report said. \\u201cAll had a peak second wave approximately six months after emergence of the virus in the human population, regardless of when the initial introduction occurred.\\u201dOn March 16, President Trump said the virus might \\u201cwash\\u201d through in warmer weather.\\nDr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation\\u2019s leading expert on infectious diseases, has expressed different opinions about the effect of summer on the virus, some more optimistic than others. In a live-streamed interview on Wednesday, Dr. Howard Bauchner, the editor in chief of The Journal of the American Medical Association, asked him about the fall, which Dr. Fauci said would be very challenging, after a period this summer when \\u201cit\\u2019s almost certainly going to go down a bit.\\u201d\\nOn March 26, however, in a conversation on Instagram with Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors, Dr. Fauci said that although it wasn\\u2019t unreasonable to assume the summer weather could diminish the spread, \\u201cyou don\\u2019t want to count on it.\\u201d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 269,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"www.who.int\",\n          \"https://www.tierneyrealnewsnetwork.com/\",\n          \"https://www.forbes.com/\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Fake\",\n          \"TRUE\",\n          \"fake\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Except for Italy which is a special case, where the peak of the death rate was 6% (see below for further analysis).China, where the death rate peaked only a few weeks ago at about 3%, is back to 0.7% \\u2013 and rapidly declining, while China is taking full control of the disease \\u2013 and that with the help of a not-spoken-about medication developed 39 years ago by Cuba, called \\u201cInterferon Alpha 2B (IFNrec)\\u201d, very effective for fighting viruses and other diseases, but is not known and used in the world, because the US under the illegal embargo of Cuba does not allow the medication to be marketed internationally.WHO has most likely received orders from \\u201cabove\\u201d, from those people who also manage Trump and the \\u201cleaders\\u201d (sic) of the European Union and her member countries, those who aim to control the world with force \\u2013 the One World Order.This has been on the drawing board for years. The final decision to go ahead NOW, was taken in January 2020 at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos \\u2013 behind very much closed doors, of course. The Gates, GAVI (an association of vaccination-promoting pharmaceuticals), Rockefellers, Rothschilds et al, they are all behind this decision \\u2013 the implementation of Agenda ID2020 \\u2013 see below. After the pandemic has been officially declared, the next step may be \\u2013 also at the recommendation either by WHO, or individual countries, \\u201cforce vaccination\\u201d, under police and/or military surveillance. Those who refuse may be penalized (fines and / or jail \\u2013 and force-vaccinated all the same).If indeed force-vaccination will happen, another bonanza for Big Pharma, people really don\\u2019t know what type of cocktail will be put into the vaccine, maybe a slow killer, that acts-up only in a few years \\u2013 or a disease that hits only the next generation \\u2013 or a brain debilitating agent, or a gene that renders women infertile \\u2026. all is possible \\u2013 always with the aim of full population control and population reduction. In a few years\\u2019 time, one doesn\\u2019t know, of course, where the disease comes from. That\\u2019s the level of technology our bio-war labs have reached (US, UK, Israel, Canada, Australia\\u2026).Another hypothesis, at this point only a hypothesis, but a realistic one, is that along with the vaccination \\u2013 if not with this one, then possibly with a later one, a nano-chip may be injected, unknown to the person being vaccinated. The chip may be remotely charged with all your personal data, including bank accounts \\u2013 digital money. Yes, digital money that\\u2019s what \\u201cthey\\u201d are aiming at, so you really have no control any more over your health and other intimate data, but also over your earnings and spending. Your money could be blocked, or taken away \\u2013 as a \\u2018sanction\\u2019 for misbehavior, for swimming against the stream. You may become a mere slave of the masters. Comparatively, feudalism may appear like a walk in the park.It\\u2019s not for nothing that Dr. Tedros, DG of WHO, said a few days ago, we must move towards digital money, because physical paper and coin money can spread diseases, especially endemic diseases, like the coronavirus. A precursor for things to come? \\u2013 Or for things already here? \\u2013 In many Scandinavian countries cash is largely banned and even a bar of chocalate can be paid only electronically.We are moving towards a totalitarian state of the world. This is part of Agenda ID2020 \\u2013 and these steps to be implemented now \\u2013 prepared since long, including by the coronavirus computer simulation at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore on 18 October 2019, sponsored by the WEF and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\\nBill Gates, one of the chief advocates of vaccinations for everybody, especially in Africa \\u2013 is also a huge advocate of population reduction. Population reduction is among the goals of the elite within the WEF, the Rockefellers, Rothschilds, Morgens \\u2013 and a few more. The objective: fewer people (a small elite) can live longer and better with the reduced and limited resources Mother Earth is generously offering.This had openly been propagated already in the 1960s and 70s by Henry Kissinger, Foreign Secretary in de Nixon Administration, a co-engineer of the Vietnam war, and main responsible for the semi-clandestine bombing of Cambodia, a genocide of millions of unarmed Cambodian civilians. Along with the CIA-Kissinger engineered coup on 9/11, 1973, in Chile, killing the democratically elected Salvador Allende and putting the military dictator Pinochet in power, Kissinger has committed war crimes. Today, he is a spokesman (so to speak) for Rockefeller and their  \\u201cBilderberger Society\\u201d.More than Just a Virus. Two weeks after the computer simulation at Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore, Maryland, that \\u201cproduced\\u201d (aka simulated) 65 million deaths (!), the COVID-19 virus first appeared in Wuhan. By now it is almost certain that the virus was brought to Wuhan from outside, most likely from a bio-war lab in the US. See also this and this.What is the infamous ID2020? It is an alliance of public-private partners, including UN agencies and civil society. It\\u2019s an electronic ID program that uses generalized vaccination as a platform for digital identity. The program harnesses existing birth registration and vaccination operations to provide newborns with a portable and persistent biometrically-linked digital identity. GAVI, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, identifies itself on its website as a global health partnership of public and private sector organizations dedicated to \\u201cimmunization for all\\u201d. GAVI is supported by WHO, and needless to say, its main partners and sponsors are the pharma-industry.The ID2020 Alliance at their 2019 Summit, entitled \\u201cRising to the Good ID Challenge\\u201d, in September 2019 in New York, decided to roll out their program in 2020, a decision confirmed by the WEF in January 2020 in Davos. Their digital identity program will be tested with the government of Bangladesh. GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, and \\u201cpartners from academia and humanitarian relief\\u201d (as they call it), are part of the pioneer party.Is it just a coincidence that ID2020 is being rolled out at the onset of what WHO calls a Pandemic? \\u2013 Or is a pandemic needed to \\u2018roll out\\u2019 the multiple devastating programs of ID2020?Here is what Anir Chowdhury, policy advisor of the Bangladesh government program, has to say:\\u201cWe are implementing a forward-looking approach to digital identity that gives individuals control over their own personal information, while still building off existing systems and programs. The Government of Bangladesh recognizes that the design of digital identity systems carries far-reaching implications for individuals\\u2019 access to services and livelihoods, and we are eager to pioneer this approach.\\u201dWow! Does Mr. Anir Chowdhury know what he is getting into?Back to the Pandemic and the panic. Geneva, the European seat of the United Nations, including the headquarters of WHO, is basically shot down. Not unlike the lock-down that started in Venice and later expanded to northern Italy until a few days ago \\u2013 and now the lock-down covers all of Italy. Similar lock-down may soon also be adopted by France \\u2013 and other European vassal states to the Anglo-Zionist empire.Numerous memoranda with similar panic-mongering contents from different UN agencies in Geneva are circulating. Their key message is \\u2013 cancel all mission travel, all events in Geneva, visits to the Palais des Nations, the Geneva Cathedral, other monuments and museums. The latest directives, many agencies instruct their staff to work from home, not to risk contamination from public transportation.This ambiance of panic and fear \\u2013 outstrips any sense of reality, when the truth doesn\\u2019t matter. People can\\u2019t even think any more about the causes and what may be behind it. Nobody believes you (anymore), when you refer to Event 201, the coronavirus simulation, the Wuhan Military Games, the closing last August 7, of the high-security biological war lab at Fort Detrick, Maryland\\u2026. what could have at one point been an eye opener for many, today is sheer conspiracy theory. The power of propaganda. A destabilizing power \\u2013 destabilizing countries and people, destroying economies, creating hardship for people who may lose their jobs, usually the ones who can least afford it.Also, at this time it becomes increasingly important to remind people that the outbreak in China was targeting the Chinese genome. Did it later mutate to transgress the \\u2018borders\\u2019 of Chinese DNA? When did that happen, if it happened? Because at the beginning it was clear that even the infected victims in other parts of the world, were to 99.9% of Chinese descent.What happened later, when the virus spread to Italy and Iran, is another issue, and opens the way to a number of speculations.There were various strains of the virus circulated in sequence \\u2013 so as to destabilize countries around the world and to confound the populace and media, so that especially nobody of the mainstream may come to the conclusion that the first strain was targeting China in a bio-war.In Iran, I have a strong suspicion that the virus was an enhanced form of MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, man-made, broke out first in Saudi Arabia in 2012 , directed to the Arabic genome) \\u2013 which was somehow introduced into government circles (by aerosol spray?) \\u2013 with the goal of \\u201cRegime Change\\u201d by COVID19-caused death. Its Washington\\u2019s wishful thinking for at least the last 30 years.In Italy \\u2013 why Italy? \\u2013 Maybe because Washington / Brussels wanted to hit Italy hard for having been officially the first country to sign a Belt and Road (BRI) accord with China (actually the first was Greece, but nobody is supposed to know that China came to the rescue of Greece, destroyed by Greece\\u2019s brothers, the EU members, mainly Germany and France).(iv) The hype about the high death to infection rate in Italy, as of the time of this writing: 10,149 infections vs. 631 deaths = death rate of 6.2 (comparatively Iran: 8042 infections vs. 291 deaths = 3.6 death rate). The death rate of Italy is almost double that of Iran and almost ten-fold that of average Europe. (Are these discrepancies the result of failures in the establishing reliable data pertaining to \\u201cinfections\\u201d, see our observations pertaining to Italy below).Why? \\u2013 Was is Italy being affected with virus panic? Was there a much stronger strain introduced to Italy?The common flu in Europe in the 2019 / 2020 season, has apparently so far killed about 16,000 (in the US the death toll is, according to CDC between 14,000 and 32,000, depending on which CDC website you look at).Could it be that among the Italian coronavirus deaths there were also common flu victims, as the affected victims are mostly elderly with respiratory preconditions? Also, symptoms are very similar between coronavirus and the common flu, and nobody questions and checks the official authorities\\u2019 narrative?Maybe not all the coronavirus strains come from the same laboratory. A journalist from Berlin of Ukrainian origin, told me this morning that Ukraine is host to some 5 high security US bio-war labs. They test regularly new viruses on the population \\u2013 yet, when strange diseases break out in the surroundings of the labs, nobody is allowed to talk about it. Something similar, she says, is happening in Georgia, where there are even more Pentagon / CIA bio-war labs \\u2013 and where also new and strange diseases break out.All of this makes the composite picture even more complicated. Overarching all is this super hype is profit driven, the quest for instant profit, instant benefits from the suffering of the people. This panic making is a hundred-fold of what it\\u2019s worth. What these kingpins of the underworld, who pretend to run the upper world, perhaps miscalculated, is that in today\\u2019s globalized and vastly outsourced world the west depends massively on China\\u2019s supply chain, for consumer goods, and for intermediary merchandise \\u2013 and, foremost for medication and medical equipment. At least 80% of medication or ingredients for medication, as well as for medical equipment comes from China. The western China dependence for antibiotics is even higher, some 90%.  The potential impacts on health are devastating.During the height of the COVID-19 epidemic China\\u2019s production apparatus for everything was almost shut-down. For deliveries that were still made, merchandise vessels were regularly and categorically turned back from many harbors all around the world. So, the west has tricked itself into a shortage-of-everything mode by waging a  de facto \\u201ceconomic war\\u201d on China. How long will it last? \\u2013 Nobody knows, but China\\u2019s economy which was down by about half, has rapidly recovered to above 80% of what it was before the coronavirus hit. How long will it last to catch up with the backlog?What is behind it all? \\u2013 A total crackdown with artificially induced panic to the point where people are screaming \\u201chelp, give us vaccinations, display police and military for our security\\u201d \\u2013 or even if the public despair doesn\\u2019t go that far, it would be easy for the EU and US authorities to impose a military stage of siege for \\u201chealth protection of the people\\u201d. In fact, CDC (Center for Disease Control in Atlanta), has already designed harshly dictatorial directives for a \\u201chealth emergency\\u201d.\\nAlong with forced vaccination, who knows what would be contained in the cocktail of \\u2018\\u2019mini-diseases\\u201d injected, and what their long-term effects might be. Similar to those of GMOs, where all sorts of germs could be inserted without us, the commons, knowing?We may indeed be just at the beginning of the implementation of ID2020 \\u2013 which includes, forced vaccination, population reduction and total digital control of everybody \\u2013 on the way to One World Order \\u2013 and global financial hegemony \\u2013 Full Spectrum Dominance, as the PNAC (Plan for a New American Century) likes to call it.A windfall for China. China has been purposely targeted for \\u201ceconomic destruction\\u201d, because of her rapidly advancing economy, an economy soon to overtake that of the now hegemon, the US of A, and because of China\\u2019s strong currency, the Yuan, also potentially overtaking the dollar as the world\\u2019s main reserve currency.\\nBoth occurrences would mean the end of US dominance over the world. The coronavirus disease, now in more than 80 countries, has crashed the stock markets, a decline of at least 20% over the last few weeks \\u2013 and rising; the feared consequences from the virus of an economic slow-down, if not recession, has slashed petrol prices within about two weeks almost in half. However, without China\\u2019s central bank interference, the Yuan\\u2019s value vis-\\u00e0-vis the dollar has been rather stable, at around 7 Yuan to the dollar. That means, the Chinese economy, despite COVID-19, is receiving still much trust around the globe.Advice to China \\u2013 buy all the US and European corporate shares you can at current rock-bottom prices from the stock markets that collapsed by a fifth or more, plus buy lots of oil futures. When the prices recover, you have not only made billions, probably trillions from the west, but you also may own or hold significant and influence-yielding amounts of shares in most of the largest US and European corporations \\u2013 and will be able to help call the shots of their future endeavors.There is however, one little silver lining oscillating at the horizon full of dark clouds. It could miraculously be an awakening of consciousness of a critical mass that could put an end to it all. Although, we seem to be far from such a miracle, somewhere in a hidden corner of our brain, we all have a spark of consciousness left. We have the spiritual capacity to abandon the disaster path of western neoliberal capitalism, and instead espouse solidarity, compassion and love for each other and for our society. That may be the only way to break the gridlock and doom of western egocentric greed.\",\n          \"Two days ago, a paper published in the Biorxiv.org journal presented findings that indicated the coronavirus appeared to be engineered with \\u201ckey structural proteins\\u201d of HIV. The paper, entitled, \\u201cUncanny similarity of unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120\\nand Gag,\\u201d concluded that the engineering of coronavirus with such gene sequences was \\u201cunlikely to be fortuitous in nature,\\u201d providing strong scientific support for the theory that the coronavirus is an engineered bioweapon that escaped laboratory containment in China. The coverage of this paper by Zero Hedge led to a firestorm of denials by governments, health authorities and the CIA-controlled media, not surprisingly. Any suggestion that the coronavirus was engineered as a bioweapon had to be immediately eliminated. The prevailing panic by the establishment sought to blame this outbreak on Mother Nature \\u2014 i.e. bats, snakes, seafood, etc. \\u2014 rather than the human beings who are playing around with deadly biological weapons that are designed to extinguish human life. Within hours, Twitter slapped down a permanent ban on Zero Hedge, making sure the independent publisher could no longer reach its Twitter audience. After all, the first casualty in any pandemic is the truth, and Jack Dorsey is not only an enabler of pedophiles and child rapists, he\\u2019s also an authoritarian tyrant who wants to make sure the public is completely isolated from any \\u201cnon official\\u201d reports about this pandemic. (Jack Dorsey has sided with communist China, in other words. Is anyone surprised?) Under the intense pressure, the authors of the original paper have now withdrawn the paper and intend to revise it. The publication that originally carried the paper now has a warning message stating, \\u201cThis article has been withdrawn. Click here for details.\\u201d (See original source link here.) No doubt the authors of this particular paper have been sufficiently threatened to revise their conclusions, and an update of their original paper will soon be posted that effectively denounces everything they stated in the original paper. The criminal wing of the science establishment strikes again, of course, and this tactic of threatening scientists with loss of funding, being blacklisted or even physically threatened and killed is not unusual at all. The CDC, NIH and even the EPA have long histories of threatening scientists with being harmed or killed if they don\\u2019t fall in line with the prevailing lies of the establishment. In some cases, they\\u2019ve even imprisoned scientists for fraud after those individuals refused to retract their papers. This has been especially common in research areas such as HIV / AIDS, pandemics and vaccines. Any scientist who finds fault with the establishment is destroyed, imprisoned or murdered. In fact, I\\u2019ve interviewed one of the science victims of this, named Judy Mikovits, PhD. Watch my full interview here, but keep reading below first, because there\\u2019s a lot more to this story that will shock you: Now, stunning new evidence has emerged that proves the coronavirus was definitely engineered in a laboratory and may have been deliberately injected into patients as part of a Chinese vaccine experiment gone wrong. As detailed by James Lyons-Weiler, PhD, founder of the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge and author of 57 peer-reviewed publications, an analysis of the gene sequence for the coronavirus finds a peculiar sequence called \\u201cpShuttle-SN.\\u201d This sequence is is the remnant of a genetic engineering sequence that\\u2019s used to insert genes into viruses and bacteria. It provides irrefutable \\u201copen source\\u201d proof that the coronavirus now circulating in the wild was engineered in a laboratory. Every lab that has the gene sequence can see this for themselves. It\\u2019s right out in the open, which is why we describe this revelation as \\u201copen source.\\u201d \\u201cOne thing we can say for certain is that this particular virus has a laboratory origin,\\u201d states Lyons-Weiler in a bombshell interview with Del Bigtree of The Highwire (see video below, via Brighteon.com, since the video would be banned everywhere else). This genomic evidence does not, however, prove whether it was produced as a bioweapon or as a vaccine experiment. It could be either one, according to Lyons-Weiler: In fact, if you then take that sequence and compare it to other proteins, we find that it\\u2019s actually a SARS protein that was put into a coronavirus for the purpose of making the vaccine work better. That\\u2019s why this element is in there, to create a more reactogenic vaccine. There\\u2019s bombshell after bombshell in this interview, especially at the 27:59 and 33:57 marks. Watch it exclusively at Brighteon.com, given that this information is of course being banned everywhere else by the anti-human tech giants, all of which are now siding with communist China to cover up the truth: If it was a vaccine experiment gone wrong, then the world is in real trouble, warns analyst Why does it matter whether the origin was a Chinese vaccine experiment vs. a bioweapon? As previous research has revealed, when these SARS insertions into the coronavirus are introduced into animal as part of a vaccine, they create heightened fatalities when patients are exposed to other coronavirus strains. In effect, being vaccinated with this particular strain of coronavirus causes individuals to be more easily killed by the common cold and other non-pandemic coronavirus strains that are circulating in the wild. Tech giants now working over time to cover it all up, censor all dissenting views, and reinforce communist China\\u2019s official lies As expected, the evil tech giants are working overtime to squelch any dissenting views and protect the vaccine industry as well as the bioweapons industry. No blame can be allowed to fall on either one. Instead, Mother Nature must be blamed for all this. And that means the truth must be silenced\\u2026 a strategy that is, of course, routine for the vaccine industry. Every channel, voice or website now exploring any human origins of this coronavirus strain \\u2014 whether related to vaccines or bioweapons \\u2014 is being rapidly de-platformed and attacked. In some cases, websites are being sabotaged and taken offline, as happened with Natural News last week (we have since recovered, which is why you are able to read this). Yet the anti-human tech giants are unified in their efforts to silence all information that contradicts official lies, no matter how scientifically accurate that information may be. Watch this important video to learn more about Big Tech and how it ran a simulation \\u2014 complete with fake news censorship highlights \\u2014 to play out the exact scenario we\\u2019re all witnessing now: A global pandemic of human origin, infecting tens of thousands of people, accompanied by a government cover-up\",\n          \"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), continues to spread globally despite unprecedented social isolation and restrictions resulting in widespread economic decline. More than 3\\u00b72 million people have been infected and more than 230\\u2008000 of them have died. To date, no treatments have been definitively shown to be effective; however, a multipronged approach to mitigate transmission, morbidity, and mortality is ongoing. While upstream prevention strategies such as vaccination are ideal, these strategies are unlikely to be available in time to address current clinical need. Instead, fast-tracking of drug development and repurposing of approved drugs has facilitated and expedited clinical trials that might hasten effective therapeutics. Many of these drugs act, at least in part, to directly limit viral replication. By contrast, the use of interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibition might have benefits by controlling the pathological immune response to the virus. Here, we expand on the theoretical basis of IL-6 inhibition and propose potential benefits from other immunomodulators that could, in theory, prove more efficacious.For the latter phase of convalescence, hospitalised patients with COVID-19 can develop a syndrome of dysregulated and systemic immune overactivation described as a cytokine storm or hyperinflammatory syndrome that worsens acute respiratory distress syndrome and can lead to multisystem organ failure.The scarce systematic data available have shown an association between ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, IL-6, IL-1, d-dimer, and C-reactive protein and severe disease. If this group can be identified before decompensation, early and aggressive immunomodulatory treatment might prevent need for intubation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. To date, observational studies suggest a possible benefit but results of placebo-controlled randomised clinical trials are not yet available. Given the methodological limitations of existing studies, more evidence is needed. With the rapidly expanding number of critically ill patients, there is an urgent need to identify multiple putative biological targets. While IL-6 inhibition attenuates key aspects of the cytokine cascade, we posit other immune targets of inhibition to be considered and their potential to be more efficacious in the setting of COVID-19, specifically IL-1 inhibitors and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors.Observational data show overlapping clinical features in severe COVID-19 with macrophage activating syndrome (MAS) and secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Hyperinflammatory states, specifically in fatal cases, highlight why consideration of HLH and MAS therapies are warranted. Furthermore, the pathogenesis underlying SARS-CoV-2 involves several key pathways that can be manipulated, and use of these therapies can mitigate the propagation of an overdriven inflammatory response (figure).Although few patients with severe COVID-19 would meet criteria for MAS, it is proposed that they are on the spectrum and that MAS or secondary HLH therapies might be of benefit. IL-1 inhibitors are key therapeutics in the treatment of MAS or secondary HLH, but also boast an impressive safety profile with risk for infection and demonstrated safety when used in pregnant women and children. By inhibiting IL-1 signalling, they reduce a prominent drive on NF-\\u03baB-mediated upregulation of multiple cytokines, including IL-6. Additionally, a post-hoc analysis of a randomised controlled trial in sepsis indicated that patients with sepsis who had features of transaminitis and coagulopathy, a phenotype emerging within the COVID-19 population, might uniquely benefit from IL-1 inhibition. Ongoing clinical trials using IL-1, IL-6, or JAK inhibitors in COVID-19 are listed in the appendix.JAK inhibitors can treat a cytokine storm by inhibiting multiple inflammatory cytokines. Most JAK inhibitors are particularly effective at JAK 1 and JAK 2 inhibition\\u2014less so JAK 3 and TYK 2\\u2014and therefore are particularly effective at inhibition of IL-6 and interferon (IFN)-\\u03b3, but also inhibit IL-2 and the IFN-\\u03b1/\\u03b2 signalling cascade. Most JAK inhibitors have been associated with increased risk for thrombosis, viral reactivation, and myelosuppression. However, these adverse effects (except myelosuppression) are likely to be dependent on duration and dose. As with IL-1 inhibitors, JAK inhibitors generally have short half-lives and can have efficacy within days. These characteristics are favourable given that duration of use in patients with COVID-19 should be short term. Ruxolitinib, a JAK 1/2 inhibitor, received US Food and Drug Administration approval for steroid-refractory graft-versus-host disease, a frequently fatal complication of allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation characterised by unconstrained inflammation and tissue damage. Off label, it has also effectively managed inflammatory complications in patients with genetic disorders that result in overactivity of the STAT1 pathway and in resistant MAS or secondary HLH of multiple causes, including viral. Further understanding of the complex crosstalk that occurs, involving both viral and host survival strategies, might identify the need to target multiple different mechanisms to safely balance viral destruction while promoting host survival. Clinical trials will be key in determining these effects across a potential heterogeneous population, while simultaneously monitoring the side-effect profile of these drugs to ensure any potential benefits are not outweighed by harms.\\nIn conclusion, as insight is gained into the clinical phenotypes associated with COVID-19, we propose JAK and IL-1 inhibitors as therapeutic targets warranting rapid investigation. Multidisciplinary collaboration with experts in haematology, inflammation, tissue damage, and repair and resolution is paramount.\\nCJT is a principal investigator for two randomised controlled trials investigating angiotensin II receptor blockers in the treatment of COVID-19 among inpatient and outpatients.

Physicists from the University of California, Berkeley, calculated that 1.6 million people in China die each year from heart, lung and stroke problems caused by China\\u2019s heavily polluted air. This level of pollution has set the stage for wide scale weakness of heart, lung, and immune system health. China is fertile ground for an outbreak, as viruses can readily take advantage of immune-compromised populations. But we\\u2019re told to just blame the viru.Wuhan, the city where the outbreak was first declared, had previously unleashed 5G wireless technology one month before people began falling sick with \\u201cflu-like\\u201d illnesses. Wuhan, on its way to becoming a \\u201csmart city,\\u201d was one of the first cities to test out its new grid of millimeter wave microwave radiation. 5G has been banned in some cities because it can cause \\u201cflu-like\\u201d illnesses and has been documented as a source of chromosomal breaks in DNA, oxidative damage to cells, and much more. Wuhan was fertile ground for respiratory viruses to take advantage of the population, because many unknowing people were having their innate immune cells oxidized by an influx of wireless radiation. But we\\u2019re told to just blame the virus.\\nHow long will the pandemonium of this virus continue and will the panic equally apply to other viruses in the future?How long will the pandemonium continue? Does anyone care that diagnostic tests are worthless for accurately defining coronavirus cases? Does anyone realize how easily case numbers can be inflated, driving hysteria through the news and into a community? Does anyone care that milder cases can be left out of the data, raising the death rate?How many people die annually from complications with the flu, pneumonia and sepsis? How many people around the world are suffering from vaccine-derived polio? What about typhus and hepatitis spreading in California? Why do children suffer from acute flaccid myelitis and RSV? In the future, will every fever and respiratory virus be treated with such authoritarian force and hysteria? Why are we supposed to fear this virus, more than all the others? It\\u2019s all about control.\\nThe World Health Organization, praising China for its pandemic response, has inadvertently pressured governments around the world to take advantage of the pandemonium, to exert force and control. In America, the news media has broadcast nonstop fear, coaxing the federal government to respond in \\u201cheroic\\u201d fashion.\\nTrying to keep the markets from plummeting, the Trump administration has enacted the strictest quarantine measures in American history; it\\u2019s all a charade of protection because the immune-compromised American population are sitting ducks anyway. The Trump Administration is falling in line and giving the CDC over $8 billion to come up with a vaccine and to pump out new antiviral drugs that will inevitably resemble dangerous and ineffective Tamiflu. By the time the vaccine comes around, the number of coronavirus cases will inevitably have trickled down, like all historical incidences of infectious disease, but the vaccine will be heralded for saving humanity (like polio vaccines were).As the media tells us all to be afraid of a virus, governments and pharmaceutical companies are taking this as a great opportunity, an opportunity to control people, mentally and physically, and to exploit our faith, as everyone looks to them for the answers. The world need not fear a new novel coronavirus. The world should be wary of the loss of liberty and mobility that may result from this pandemonium: mandatory vaccine laws enacted by a fully-funded WHO and a paramilitary CDC. We should fear the invention of National IDs, driver\\u2019s licenses and/or passports that require everyone to submit to vaccines. We should be repulsed by the potential for roadside checkpoints and airports that could require vaccine administration and further testing of people\\u2019s body fluids. We should be wary that authoritarians will put cities and public events on lock down or how the military could be used to round people up or quarantine individuals over a fever. Because of the hysteria and pandemonium, we are slowly losing the freedom to congregate and the ability to travel abroad.These extreme measures will further convince people that the virus is dangerous, that we all need to secure order, but this authoritarian approach and its effects do not confirm that the virus is the problem or that those in charge are of goodwill.  The virus is an opportunity, a tool for sociopaths and authoritarians to exert mass control.\",\n          \"The EU has the highest consumer standards in the world. It is the reason that we can walk into a shop and feel confident in the products we buy. 5G is held to these incredibly high standards. In fact, our standards are far above those indicated by international scientific evidence \\u2013 because in the EU, people come first.\\n\\nThere is no connection between 5G and COVID-19. The Coronavirus is a virus that is spread from one person to another through droplets that people sneeze, cough or exhale. 5G is the new generation of mobile network technology that is transmitted over non-ionising radio waves. There is no evidence that 5G is harmful to people\\u2019s health. The outbreak of coronavirus in the Chinese city of Wuhan is unrelated to 5G, and is thought to have originated in a seafood wholesale market.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 269,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"www.who.int\",\n          \"https://www.tierneyrealnewsnetwork.com/\",\n          \"https://www.forbes.com/\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"True\",\n          \"Fake\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labelInt\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"int8\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
